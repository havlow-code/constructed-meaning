# Constructed Meaning — Automation Systems & AI Workflows
This repository contains practical, production-ready automation systems.

The focus is not experimentation, but building workflows that:
- solve real business problems
- handle messy input and edge cases
- remain stable in production

## Stack
- n8n (automation engine)
- AI models (Gemini, Claude, Codex)
- Google Sheets (temporary datastore)
- Vercel (frontend when required)

## Structure
- SPEC.md — source of truth
- TODO.md — execution plan
- Workflows exported as JSON
